# gitvm

This was supposed to be full x86 OS emulation in browser which dynmically generated iso9660 disk images from the zip files of the master branch from github repos and allowed you to rapidly spin up a VM and play with code entirely in browser.

Turns out, it's possible! But this repo is empty because the files are too big to commit so it's all on an SSD. Still need to implement dynamic ISO images generation, but it boots!
